I used this HTML, CSS, and Javascript boilerplate from html5up to build my portfolio website. Using my HTML, and CSS knowledge,
I was able to edit, add, and delete the existing code as needed. I chose to build my portfolio website using a boilerplate because
my focus is on back-end developement. This website showcases some of my most recent Java projects, and It'll allow me to expand upon it,
adding additional projects in the future.
