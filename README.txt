I leveraged an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript boilerplate from html5up to develop my professional portfolio website. With my proficiency in HTML and CSS, I modified, added, and removed code elements to suit my specific requirements. Opting for a boilerplate solution was a strategic decision, driven by my focus in back-end development. The website serves as a platform to showcase my latest Java projects while providing flexibility for future expansion by incorporating additional projects.
